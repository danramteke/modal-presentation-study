Show how to make a "floating" modal presentation view controller


`SomeOtherViewController` has a pink background color with the opacity turned down so you can see through it. Then I place a UIView with some subviews of what I want the view to look like.


The Segue from the "Show modal" button, I set the segue to be "Present Modally" and the presentation to be "Over Current Context" in the storyboard inspector for the segue.


That's it I think.
